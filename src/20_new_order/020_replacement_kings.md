# Chapter 5: The Replacement Kings

After the Bronze Age destruction, something unprecedented happened in human history. For thousands of years, kings had claimed Regal descent - "I am the son of **The Reges**." Suddenly, around 1200 BC, they started making a completely different claim: "**The Reges** chose me to rule."

This wasn't just a change in rhetoric. It represented a fundamental shift in the entire system of human governance.

## The End of Regal Bloodlines

As I traced the genealogies of post-conquest **Reges**, the pattern became clear. The new kings weren't claiming descent from the old god-kings - they were explicitly rejecting those bloodlines.

**Before the conquest:**

- Egyptian pharaohs claimed to be living **Reges** (echoes of the administrator-class, **The Reges**)
- Mesopotamian kings claimed Regal parentage
- Hittite **Reges** claimed descent from storm **Reges** (echoes of **The Reges**)
- Mycenaean kings claimed descent from Zeus and other Olympians (cultural echoes of **The Reges**)

**After the conquest:**

- New **Reges** claimed Regal appointment, not Regal descent
- Emphasis on being "chosen" by distant, invisible **Reges**
- Systematic rejection of claims to Regal bloodlines
- Installation of human intermediaries rather than hybrid **Reges**

The conquerers hadn't just eliminated the hybrid bloodlines - they had replaced the entire system of Regal kingship with something completely different.

## The Appointed Authority System

The new system was sophisticated in its simplicity. Instead of god-kings who ruled by virtue of their hybrid nature, there were now human kings who ruled by virtue of Regal appointment.

**Key characteristics of the new system:**

- Authority came from invisible, distant **Reges** rather than present, physical ones
- **Reges** were temporary appointees rather than permanent administrator-class agents
- Power could be transferred or withdrawn by the appointing authority
- Human intermediaries (priests) interpreted Regal will
- Complex bureaucracies replaced direct Regal administration

This system was much more controllable than the old god-king system. Appointed **Reges** could be replaced if they became problematic. Regal authority remained distant and unverifiable.

## The Invisible Commanders

But this raised the question that had been haunting my investigation: who was doing the appointing?

The new kings claimed to be chosen by **Reges**, but these **Reges** were notably absent from direct involvement in human affairs. Unlike the old **Reges** who were physically present and actively ruling, the new authorities remained invisible and communicated only through human intermediaries.

**Someone was still running the system, but they had moved into the shadows.**
