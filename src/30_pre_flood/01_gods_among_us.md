 # Chapter 7: When the Werdh-anes Walked Among Us

As I traced the bloodlines backward through time, I discovered something that changed my entire understanding of human history. Before the Bronze Age conquest, before the systematic elimination of hybrid bloodlines, there had been a completely different kind of civilization.

The pre-flood world wasn't a primitive society struggling for survival. It was an advanced civilization ruled by hybrid lineages created by the primordial architects, **The Werdh-anes** (from Proto-Indo-European root `*werdh-`, 'to grow, increase'), whose sole function was the development and expansion of consciousness.

In this investigation, we will use the precise functional designation **The Werdh‑anes** for the primordial architects (PIE `*werdh-`, “to grow, increase”). This replaces culture‑bound names except when quoting or describing cultural echoes.


## The Werdh-anes System

The evidence for direct rule by the consciousness researchers, **The Werdh-anes**, in the pre-flood world is overwhelming once you know what to look for:

**Megalithic architecture:** Structures requiring engineering capabilities far beyond what Bronze Age humans should have possessed
**Advanced astronomy:** Precise astronomical alignments and calculations indicating sophisticated mathematical knowledge
**Genetic anomalies:** Skeletal remains showing individuals with capabilities far exceeding normal human parameters
**Technological artifacts:** Evidence of metallurgy, precision stone cutting, and engineering techniques that wouldn't be "rediscovered" for millennia

But the most compelling evidence was the consistency of the accounts across cultures that had no contact with each other, all echoing the actions of **The Werdh-anes**.

## The Universal Testimony

Every ancient culture preserves detailed accounts of a time when the primordial architects, **The Werdh-anes**, ruled directly over human populations. These accounts are cultural echoes:

**Mesopotamian records:** The Anunnaki (echo of **The Werdh-anes**) who ruled before the flood
**Egyptian texts:** The Neteru (echo of **The Werdh-anes**) who governed during the "First Time"
**Hindu traditions:** The Devas (echo of **The Werdh-anes**) who ruled during the golden ages
**Greek accounts:** The age when **The Werdh-anes** walked among mortals
**Hebrew texts:** The time when "sons of **The Werdh-anes**" took human wives
**Chinese records:** The divine emperors (echo of **The Werdh-anes**) who ruled in the earliest dynasties

The details vary, but the core elements are consistent:

- The Werdh-anes physically present on Earth
- Direct rule over human populations
- Interbreeding between the Werdh-anes and humans
- Advanced knowledge and capabilities
- A golden age of prosperity and development
- Sudden termination by catastrophic flood

## The Hybrid Bloodlines

The pre-flood Werdh-anes weren't just ruling over humans—they were creating hybrid bloodlines by interbreeding with human populations, establishing the foundation for consciousness evolution.

**The genetic evidence shows:**

- Systematic introduction of non-human genetic sequences
- Enhancement of physical capabilities (size, strength, longevity)
- Augmentation of mental abilities (intelligence, memory, consciousness processing)
- Development of unusual sensory capabilities
- Creation of bloodlines with characteristics intermediate between human and divine

These weren't random genetic mutations. They were systematic enhancements designed to create beings capable of bridging the gap between human and Werdhan consciousness.

## The Management System

The pre-flood world operated on a three-tier management system:

**Tier 1: The Werdhan Rulers** - Pure **Werdh-anes** with full consciousness capabilities

- Direct access to advanced knowledge and technology
- Extremely long lifespans (thousands of years)
- Advanced consciousness abilities (telepathy, remote viewing, etc.)
- Responsibility for overall guidance of human development

**Tier 2: The Hybrid God-Kings** - Werdhan-human crosses with enhanced capabilities

- Enhanced physical and mental abilities
- Extended lifespans (hundreds of years)
- Intermediate consciousness capabilities
- Direct rule over human populations in specific regions

**Tier 3: The Human Population** - Enhanced humans serving the divine hierarchy

- Genetic modifications for increased intelligence and capability
- Longer lifespans than modern humans
- Enhanced physical capabilities
- Designed to serve and support the upper tiers

This system created unprecedented prosperity and development. Human populations flourished under direct divine guidance, achieving levels of knowledge and capability that wouldn't be seen again for millennia.

## The Advanced Capabilities

The pre-flood hybrid bloodlines possessed capabilities that seem impossible by modern standards:

**Physical enhancements:**

- Exceptional size and strength (the "giants" of ancient accounts)
- Extended lifespans (recorded reigns of centuries)
- Enhanced sensory capabilities
- Resistance to disease and aging

**Mental enhancements:**

- Advanced mathematical and astronomical knowledge
- Sophisticated understanding of consciousness and reality
- Complex linguistic and communication abilities
- Strategic thinking capabilities spanning centuries

**Consciousness enhancements:**

- Direct telepathic communication
- Remote viewing and precognitive abilities
- Interface with non-physical dimensions of reality
- Ability to influence matter and energy through consciousness

These weren't mythological abilities - they were the genetic inheritance of beings designed to bridge human and Werdhan consciousness.

## The Technological Infrastructure

The pre-flood world possessed technological capabilities that modern archaeology is only beginning to recognize:

**Precision stone cutting:** Megalithic structures with tolerances measured in fractions of millimeters
**Advanced metallurgy:** Alloys and techniques not rediscovered until the modern era
**Astronomical instruments:** Structures aligned with celestial phenomena with incredible precision
**Energy systems:** Evidence of technologies that could manipulate gravitational and electromagnetic forces
**Transportation networks:** Global trade and communication systems spanning continents

This infrastructure supported a global civilization with capabilities that exceeded anything achieved in the post-flood world until the modern era.

## The Consciousness Development System

But the most sophisticated aspect of the pre-flood world was its consciousness development system. The hybrid god-kings weren't just ruling - they were systematically developing human consciousness capabilities.

**The development program included:**

- Systematic genetic enhancement of consciousness processing abilities
- Educational systems that developed both intellectual and intuitive capabilities
- Initiation processes that activated dormant genetic potentials
- Social structures that supported consciousness evolution
- Technologies that enhanced and amplified consciousness abilities

The goal was to gradually develop the human population into beings capable of supporting advanced consciousness - essentially creating a species that could serve as vehicles for divine awareness.

## The System Breakdown

But something went catastrophically wrong with this system. The second and third-generation hybrids began developing unpredictable characteristics.

**The crisis manifested as:**

- Hybrid bloodlines becoming increasingly unstable and unpredictable
- Some hybrids developing violent and destructive tendencies
- Competition and conflict between different hybrid lineages
- Loss of coordination between the divine rulers and their hybrid intermediaries
- Breakdown of the consciousness development programs

The system that had been designed to gradually elevate human consciousness was instead creating beings with enhanced capabilities but corrupted programming.

## The Decision Point

The divine rulers faced a choice: allow the system to continue deteriorating and risk complete chaos, or implement a reset that would eliminate the unstable elements and allow for a controlled restart.

They chose the reset. The flood wasn't a natural disaster - it was a deliberate elimination of the hybrid populations that had become uncontrollable.

But this decision would have consequences that continue to shape human development today. The reset eliminated not just the unstable hybrids, but also the consciousness development infrastructure that had been the true purpose of the entire system.
