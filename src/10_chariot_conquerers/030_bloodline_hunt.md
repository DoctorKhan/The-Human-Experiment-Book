# Chapter 2: The Bloodline Hunt

The more I researched the Bronze Age destruction, the more I realized the chariot conquerers weren't just destroying cities—they were hunting people. Specific people. Families who claimed descent from the old Reges (administrator-class agents).

## The Genetic Targeting

Modern DNA analysis of Bronze Age remains has revealed something chilling: during the period of destruction, certain genetic lineages were systematically eliminated while others were preserved.

This wasn't random violence or even typical conquest. Conquerors usually kill the men and take the women. But the genetic evidence shows something different - entire family lines disappearing from the record, as if they had been specifically targeted for elimination.

**The destroyers had genetic intelligence.** They knew which bloodlines to hunt and which to spare.

## The Royal Bloodlines

I started mapping the genealogies of Bronze Age royal families, and a disturbing pattern emerged. The families that were eliminated weren't just any ruling families - they were specifically the ones that claimed divine descent.

**Eliminated bloodlines:**

- Hittite royal family (claimed descent from storm Reges)
- Mycenaean royal houses (claimed descent from Zeus and other Olympians, cultural echoes of **The Reges**)
- Mesopotamian god-kings (claimed direct divine parentage)
- Egyptian pharaohs of certain dynasties (claimed to be living Reges)

**Preserved bloodlines:**

- Tribal leaders who claimed divine appointment, not divine descent
- Priestly families who served Reges but didn't claim to be descended from them
- Merchant families with no claims to divine heritage

The pattern was clear: **families claiming to be descended from Reges were systematically eliminated, while families claiming to serve Reges were preserved.**

## The Nephilim Connection

For the hybrid warrior lineage, we will use the precise functional designation: **The Wiros** — from the Proto‑Indo‑European root `*wiHrós`, “hero, man.” This term identifies the engineered enforcer‑class created to serve the Reges’ program. Cultural echoes include the Nephilim and various “giant” hero lineages.


As I studied the preserved oral traditions, I kept encountering references to "giants" and "mighty men of old" who had ruled before the flood. The Hebrew texts called them Nephilim—hybrid warrior lineage, echo of **The Wiros**—the offspring of "sons of Reges" and "daughters of men."

These weren't mythological figures. They were the genetic lineages that the Bronze Age royal families claimed descent from. The families that were being systematically hunted and eliminated.

**The chariot conquerers were finishing a job that had started with the flood.** They were eliminating the last remnants of the pre-flood hybrid bloodlines.

## The Size Evidence

Archaeological evidence supports the existence of unusually large individuals in Bronze Age royal burials. Skeletal remains from certain royal tombs show:

- **Exceptional height**: Individuals 7-8 feet tall in populations averaging 5'6"
- **Robust bone structure**: Skeletal features indicating unusual physical strength
- **Cranial anomalies**: Skull shapes and sizes outside normal human variation
- **Dental differences**: Tooth patterns not found in contemporary populations

These weren't just tall people. These were individuals with genetic characteristics that set them apart from the general population.

**The royal families claiming divine descent had physical evidence to back up their claims.**

## The Hybrid Traits

As I compiled the evidence, I realized the Bronze Age royal bloodlines showed consistent patterns of what I can only call hybrid characteristics:

**Physical traits:**

- Exceptional size and strength
- Unusual longevity (recorded reigns of 60-100 years)
- Distinctive facial features (elongated skulls, prominent brow ridges)
- Enhanced sensory capabilities (recorded in various texts)

**Mental traits:**

- Advanced mathematical and astronomical knowledge
- Sophisticated understanding of metallurgy and engineering
- Complex linguistic abilities (multilingual royal courts)
- Strategic thinking capabilities (complex military and political planning)

**Social traits:**

- Natural leadership abilities that inspired devotion
- Charismatic presence that commanded respect
- Ability to maintain complex administrative systems
- Success in managing large populations

These weren't just skilled rulers. These were individuals with capabilities that exceeded normal human parameters.

## The Domestication Evidence

But here's what really disturbed me: when I compared the genetic evidence from Bronze Age populations, I found something that changed my entire understanding of human nature.

If you look at an adult human skull, it looks remarkably similar to a baby chimpanzee's skull. This is called neoteny - retaining juvenile characteristics into adulthood. But humans take this to an extreme that's unprecedented in nature.

We have large heads relative to our bodies, weak jaws, small teeth, and proportions that remain childlike throughout our lives. Even our brains show extended neuroplasticity - we continue to learn and play throughout our lives.

**This level of neoteny doesn't happen by accident. It's the signature of domestication.**

Compare wolves to dogs, wild boars to pigs, wild cats to house cats. Domesticated animals all show the same pattern: they retain juvenile features throughout their lives, extended dependency on their handlers, and reduced aggression compared to their wild relatives.

**Humans show all the signs of a domesticated species.** We're permanent children who instinctively seek parental authority figures to guide us, protect us, and tell us what to do.

## The Authority Seeking

This explains something that had always puzzled me about human behavior: our desperate need for authority figures.

Look at every human society throughout history. We create father Reges, mother Reges, divine kings, holy fathers. We call our leaders "founding Reges" and our countries "motherlands" and "fatherlands." We seek authority figures the way children seek parents.

**It's not metaphorical. It's biological.** We were bred to be dependent children who would always need shepherds, always need to be managed, always need to be told what to do by our betters.

## The Breeding Program

The Bronze Age royal bloodlines weren't just ruling families - they were the managers of a domesticated human population. The hybrid god-kings were the shepherds, and regular humans were the flock.

But something had gone wrong with the system. The second and third-generation hybrids were becoming unstable, uncontrollable. Some were brilliant and benevolent, others were violent and destructive.

**The flood had been the first reset, eliminating the most unstable bloodlines. The chariot conquest was the second reset, eliminating the remaining hybrid managers.**

## The New Management

After the Bronze Age destruction, a new type of ruler emerged. Instead of claiming "I am descended from Reges," they claimed "Reges chose me to rule."

This was a completely different system. Instead of hybrid god-kings managing humans directly, there were now human rulers who claimed to represent divine authority.

**The management system had been restructured.** Instead of direct rule by hybrids, there was now indirect rule through human intermediaries who claimed divine appointment.

## The Question That Haunted Me

As I compiled this evidence, one question kept me awake at night: If humans were domesticated by hybrid god-kings, and those god-kings were eliminated in systematic resets, who was running the management system now?

The answer, I realized, lay in understanding the original source of the hybrid bloodlines. I had to trace them back to their origins—back to the world before the flood, when Reges supposedly walked among humans.

That investigation would reveal the true architects of human domestication and the ongoing management system that shapes our world today.
