### The Scientific Gaps: Where the Story Begins

Before we dive into the experiment, it's crucial to acknowledge the story that mainstream science already tells: a story full of missing pieces. The fossil record, despite a century of searching, is riddled with unexplained gaps—the very gaps that our investigation will attempt to fill. The most significant are:

- **The 8-Million-Year Ape Disappearance:** Between 16 and 7 million years ago, our ape ancestors essentially vanish from the African fossil record. This is a crucial, 8-million-year blackout right at the point where our lineage began to diverge.
- **The "Big Bang" of Genus Homo:** Around 3 million years ago, the genus Homo—our direct ancestors—appears almost out of nowhere in the fossil record, with larger brains, smaller teeth, and the sudden emergence of stone tool use. The geological layers that should contain this transition have simply eroded away.
- **The "Muddle in the Middle":** Between 800,000 and 130,000 years ago, human evolution becomes what scientists politely call a tangled mess. Multiple human species coexisted, interbred, and left behind confusing fossils that defy a simple, linear family tree.

These aren't minor holes; they're the missing origins of our bipedalism, our large brains, and our unique tool-making abilities. Mainstream science acknowledges these mysteries and has been unable to solve them, leaving the door open for a deeper investigation.
