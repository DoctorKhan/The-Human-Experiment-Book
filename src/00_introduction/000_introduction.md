The bombs dropped all around us. My parents lost friends—some to the chaos, some to the violence. But they survived. My mother was shot in the leg, a wound that would never fully heal. They were lucky, if luck means simply making it through alive.

After the war, the landscape was transformed. Amputees and the injured filled the streets, as far as the eye could see. The country itself had been reduced to rubble—buildings shattered, families scattered, dreams buried beneath the debris. But we were alive. We were free. That freedom was raw, uncertain, and hard-won, but it was ours.

Years later, I returned to visit the National Parliament building. The Pakistanis had spared it, not out of mercy, but because they mistook it for ancient ruins. Its battered walls stood as a silent witness to history—a place that had survived not because of its importance, but because of a misunderstanding. In that moment, I saw how survival itself can be accidental, how history is shaped by chance as much as by courage.

They destroyed the country in the war. Every major facility, and executed all the famous artists, scientists, and any culture bearers.

War is a terrible thing.
