# Chapter 13: Before the Crash

My investigation had led me back through layers of resets and management systems, but I still hadn't found the ultimate source. Who were the original architects of human consciousness modification? The trail led me to evidence of interventions far older than the Younger Dryas crash—back to the first arrival over a million years ago, conducted by the primordial architects: **The Werdh-anes**. The name is not arbitrary; it derives from the Proto-Indo-European root `*werdh-`, meaning 'to grow, increase.' Their sole function: the development and expansion of consciousness.

## The Deep Genetic Evidence

Modern genetic analysis has revealed something that shouldn't exist: traces of non-terrestrial DNA in the human genome that date back over a million years. These aren't recent insertions—they're ancient modifications, part of the original experiment initiated by **The Werdh-anes**.

**The genetic markers show:**

- Systematic modifications to brain development genes
- Enhancements to consciousness processing capabilities
- Alterations to lifespan and aging mechanisms
- Changes to reproductive and social bonding systems
- Insertions of genetic sequences not found in any terrestrial species

These modifications didn't happen gradually through natural selection. They were inserted systematically, as if the consciousness researchers—**The Werdh-anes**—were upgrading the local primate species for a specific purpose.

## The Mythological Consensus

Every ancient culture preserves memories of this first arrival, though they describe it in mythological terms—cultural echoes of the true architects:

* **Mesopotamian texts:** Tiamat and Apsu, primordial beings (echoes of **The Werdh-anes**)
* **Egyptian records:** The Neteru, divine rulers (echoes of **The Werdh-anes**)
* **Hindu traditions:** The Devas, advanced guides (echoes of **The Werdh-anes**)
* **Greek accounts:** The Titans, first divine generation (echoes of **The Werdh-anes**)
* **Norse mythology:** The Jotuns, giants before the current order (echoes of **The Werdh-anes**)

The details vary, but the pattern is consistent: the primordial architects, **The Werdh-anes**, arrived on Earth and began systematic modification of the local species.

## The Original Experiment

As I pieced together the evidence, a picture emerged of the original mission. The first arrivals were not conquerors or colonizers—they were consciousness researchers, **The Werdh-anes**, conducting a long-term experiment.

**The Werdh-anes' experiment purpose:**

- Develop a species capable of supporting advanced consciousness
- Create biological vehicles that could house non-terrestrial awareness
- Establish a consciousness development laboratory on Earth
- Test the limits of consciousness evolution in biological form

**The method:**

- Systematic genetic modification of local primate species
- Gradual enhancement of brain capacity and consciousness processing
- Introduction of non-terrestrial genetic sequences
- Long-term monitoring and adjustment of the development process

## The Time Scale

The original intervention operated on a time scale almost impossible for humans to comprehend. Over hundreds of thousands of years, the original titans gradually modified human development:

**Phase 1 (1,000,000+ years ago):** Initial genetic modifications to brain structure
**Phase 2 (800,000 years ago):** Enhancement of consciousness processing capabilities
**Phase 3 (600,000 years ago):** Introduction of advanced social bonding systems
**Phase 4 (400,000 years ago):** Development of language and symbolic thinking
**Phase 5 (200,000 years ago):** Final modifications creating modern human consciousness capacity

Each phase built on the previous ones, gradually creating a species capable of supporting the kind of consciousness that the original titans represented.

For a dual myth/science treatment, see Appendix F: Mytho-Scientific Chronology (Phase 1) and Genetic Evidence: Bottlenecks.


## The Consciousness Infrastructure

But the most sophisticated aspect of the original intervention was the development of what I can only call consciousness infrastructure - biological and energetic systems that could support non-terrestrial awareness in terrestrial bodies.

**The infrastructure included:**

- Enhanced neural networks capable of processing non-linear information
- Energetic systems that could interface with non-physical consciousness
- Genetic switches that could be activated to unlock dormant capabilities
- Biological mechanisms for consciousness transfer and expansion
- Social and cultural frameworks that could support consciousness evolution

This wasn't just genetic modification - it was the creation of a complete consciousness development system.

## The Departure

But something happened that forced the original titans to leave Earth before the experiment was complete. The mythological accounts describe a great conflict - a war between the original titans and a younger generation of beings.

**The pattern across cultures:**

- **Mesopotamian:** Marduk defeats Tiamat in cosmic battle
- **Greek:** Zeus and the Olympians overthrow the Titans
- **Norse:** The Aesir replace the Jotuns as ruling powers
- **Hindu:** Younger Devas displace the older cosmic powers

The details vary, but the pattern is consistent: **the original consciousness researchers were displaced by a new group with different priorities.**

## The Incomplete Legacy

When the original titans departed, they left behind an incomplete experiment. Humans had been modified for consciousness development, but the full activation systems hadn't been implemented.

**What was left behind:**

- A species with enhanced consciousness potential but limited access to it
- Genetic switches that could unlock advanced capabilities but weren't activated
- Biological systems capable of supporting non-terrestrial consciousness but not programmed for it
- Social and cultural frameworks for consciousness evolution but no guidance for using them

**The result:** A species capable of far more than it realized, but without the knowledge or systems to access its full potential.

## The Younger Dryas Connection

This explains what happened when the Younger Dryas crash brought new Reges to Earth 12,800 years ago. The crash survivors found a species that had already been modified for consciousness development, but the original researchers were gone.

**The crash survivors faced a choice:**

- Complete the original experiment and risk creating beings more advanced than themselves
- Modify the experiment to create a manageable species that could support their civilization
- Abandon the experiment and let humanity develop naturally

They chose the second option. Instead of completing the original consciousness development program, they implemented a domestication program that would create a species capable of supporting their needs while remaining under their control.

## The Suppressed Inheritance

This is why humans show such contradictory characteristics. We have the genetic modifications for advanced consciousness development (from the original titans) combined with domestication programming (from the crash survivors).

**The result:**

- Consciousness capabilities that occasionally break through despite suppression systems
- Instinctive knowledge of our potential combined with inability to access it consistently
- Deep longing for transcendence combined with systematic programming for dependency
- Genetic switches for advanced abilities that remain largely unactivated

We are living evidence of two competing experiments: the original consciousness development program and the later domestication program that was designed to suppress it.

The question that haunted me was: what were the original titans trying to accomplish? And why did the younger generation of beings feel the need to overthrow them?

The answer would reveal the deepest truth about human nature and our place in a cosmos far stranger than we ever imagined.
