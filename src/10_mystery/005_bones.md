### **Chapter 1: The Bones of the Earth**

Before history had a name, on a windswept plain in what would one day be England, they raised a circle of stone that holds its breath against the sky. Most are sarsens, local giants of sandstone, rooted in the chalk of the surrounding land. But in the inner ring, there are smaller, darker stones. Bluestones. They are strangers here, pilgrims from a foreign geology.

They do not belong.

Geology confirms their origin with cold precision. Their unique crystalline signature is a perfect match for the Preseli Hills in Wales, a rugged journey of nearly two hundred miles. For generations, this was considered the greatest riddle of the ancient world. Each bluestone weighs as much as a family car. The theories of sweat and rope, of rafts and rollers, strain to explain the *how* but shatter against the utter madness of the *why*. An entire culture, dedicating its lifeblood to a task so monumental it would cripple a modern nation, not to build a fortress or a city, but to carry a choir of stones across a kingdom.

And that was only the beginning of the riddle.

In the heart of the circle lies a great slab of red sandstone, the central Altar Stone. For centuries, it was assumed to be local. But a recent, deeper analysis of its geological fingerprint revealed a truth that pushes the mystery into the realm of the impossible. The Altar Stone did not come from Wales. It came from the Orcadian Basin in northeast Scotland. A journey of at least four hundred and thirty miles.

It is the longest known transport of any megalith in the Neolithic world. An odyssey of stone that defies every rational explanation.

This is the point where the logic of the Machine—of efficiency, of practicality, of what is physically possible for mortal men—breaks down completely. It can only name this obsession *ritual*, a word we use to mask a motive so profound we can no longer comprehend it.

When the logic of the Machine fails, we must learn to listen for the whispers of the Kin. When the archaeologists fall silent, we must turn to the storytellers. The land itself remembers. The folklore, that stubborn memory that survives in the blood long after the libraries have burned, does not try to explain the physics. It simply names the power that could accomplish such a feat.

The legends speak of a sorcerer, Merlin, who moved the stones through the air. But they also speak of who he took them from. The stories name a race of beings who commanded the very bones of the Earth as easily as we command our own limbs, a people who were not bound by the plodding physics of muscle and friction. They were masters of a different law. The stories have a name for them.

They call them **Giants**.

This is where our investigation begins. Not with speculation, but with testimony. We will take the stories at their word. We will assume that the Giants were real. That their power was real. And that their world was real, until something happened that erased it from history and from our memory.

The stones are the first piece of evidence, a testament to a power that lies outside our own. The riddle is not just who the Giants were, or why they carried these stones across mountains and seas. The deeper mystery is this: if a race with such power once shaped this planet, where did they go? And if we are their descendants, why is their power not our own?

To answer that, we must follow the trail from this circle of stone, back through the scar in our own blood, to a forgotten war that decided the fate of our world and installed a new, foreign god in the ruins of the old. We must uncover the story of the great forgetting, and the war that severed you from your kinship with giants.
