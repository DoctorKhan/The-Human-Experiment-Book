# Glossary of Terms

### A

**Abraham's Covenant** - The establishment of monotheistic covenant system around 4,000 years ago as a sophisticated evolution of control technology. Replaced polytheistic confusion with single authority, created chosen people concept, and introduced moral law as internalized control mechanism.

**Adamu** - The first earth-born chimeras created by the Titans through genetic modification of early hominids. Ancient texts describe seven pairs (fourteen individuals) being created as different experimental approaches to human enhancement. Multiple variants were created, but only one line (the Umannu) proved successful in the long term. The name derives from ancient Mesopotamian texts referring to the first humans. The Hindu tradition of fourteen Manus provides parallel evidence for this systematic creation protocol.

**Asherah** - Archaeological evidence from the "Yahweh and his Asherah" inscription suggests this functioned as a title for a divine consort or sacred object rather than a fixed personal name. This supports the interpretation that many ancient divine names represent roles or functions rather than individual identities.

**Albians** - The final survivors carrying significant Titan genetic heritage, displaying hybrid characteristics similar to tigons and ligers. They established their stronghold in Albion (Britain), preserving Titan consciousness technologies through stone circle networks (Stonehenge, Avebury) and matrifocal social structures. Systematically eliminated during the Bell Beaker expansion (~4,500-3,500 years ago), which brought up to 90% population replacement to the British Isles. Archaeological evidence shows violent conquest by Indo-European warrior cultures, though Albian knowledge was encoded into surviving megalithic structures and later Celtic traditions.

**Age of Heroes** - The Bronze Age period (~3,500-1,200 years ago) representing the final era of direct divine-human interaction. Heroes like Gilgamesh, Hercules, and Achilles represent the last generation of human-divine hybrids with enhanced capabilities.
**Anunnaki** - The younger generation of beings (Anu, Enlil, Marduk) who overthrew the older Titan generation during the cosmic war marked by the Younger Dryas impact (12,900 years ago). They represented a different philosophy - preferring direct, systematic control over the Titans' patient, evolutionary approach to human development.

**Apkallu** - Ancient Mesopotamian term for the "seven sages" or divine beings who brought civilization to humanity. In this framework, they represent the Titan overseers who managed human development during the Domestication Period.

### B

**Binary Programming** - Originally installed by the Titans as a temporary learning tool to help early humans process complex information. Later exploited by the Anunnaki for permanent control, reducing complex reality into simple either/or choices (good/evil, us/them, right/wrong). This programming makes humans predictable and manageable by bypassing complex reasoning through emotional triggers.

## D

**Divine Titles** - Archaeological and textual evidence suggests that names like Enki, Enlil, Yahweh, and Asherah may represent titles or roles rather than fixed personal names. This explains apparent contradictions in mythological accounts where the same "character" displays different personalities or functions. Like modern titles (CEO, Judge, General), these designations describe divine functions that could be held by different consciousnesses in different contexts.

## G

**MIS 6 Modification Period** - The gradual genetic enhancement period during Marine Isotope Stage 6 (150,000-130,000 years ago) when expanding ice sheets fragmented human populations into isolated refugia. Within this framework, this was Phase II of the Titan experiment - using natural population separation to systematically modify isolated groups without detection, installing sophisticated genetic modifications and receiver protocols.

**Great Catastrophe/Deluge** - Not a single event, but the cyclical pattern of reset events that have shaped human history. Different cultures preserve memories of different resets in their flood myths: the 4.2 kiloyear event (biblical deluge), the Younger Dryas impact, and other civilizational collapses. Each reset served different purposes in the ongoing human experiment.

**Göbekli Tepe** - Massive temple complex constructed 11,600 years ago, representing the first major Anunnaki construction project. Served as memorial to defeated Titans and template for organized labor under centralized control. Deliberately buried around 10,000 years ago as part of systematic erasure of Titan-era evidence.

## H

**HAR1 (Human Accelerated Region 1)** - A regulatory RNA gene expressed in neurons of the developing human neocortex that shows accelerated evolution in the human lineage. In this mythology, HAR1 represents one of the key genetic switches activated during Phase III of the experiment.

**Hybrid Genetics** - The Nephilim displayed characteristics similar to tigons and ligers in modern big cat breeding: first-generation hybrid vigor with enhanced capabilities, followed by genetic instability and fertility issues in later generations. This required systematic breeding programs to maintain hybrid lines, contributing to the 17:1 reproductive bottleneck.

## M

**Manu** - In Hindu tradition, the progenitors of humanity across different cosmic ages. Fourteen Manus rule over successive periods (Manvantaras), with each cosmic age ending in destruction of the current human type and emergence of a new Manu with enhanced capabilities. This tradition parallels the Mesopotamian seven pairs of Adamu, suggesting global memory of systematic human genetic engineering. We currently live under the seventh Manu (Vaivasvata), approaching a transition to the eighth.

**Mooneyed People** - Cherokee term for the builders of Fort Mountain's 900-foot stone wall in Georgia. Descriptions vary between small, pale beings and strong, cannibalistic giants with red or blonde hair. These seemingly contradictory accounts likely preserve memories of both hybrid lineages: the small, pale descriptions corresponding to Albians (goddess-human hybrids with astronomical knowledge), and the giant descriptions corresponding to Nephilim (aggressive Titan-human hybrids who "devoured the land").

## N

**Nephilim** - Biblical term for the "giants" or "fallen ones" - the offspring of divine beings and human women. In this framework, they represent hybrid descendants displaying characteristics similar to tigons and ligers: first-generation vigor with enhanced capabilities, but genetic instability and fertility issues in later generations requiring constant breeding program management.

## S

**Sintashta** - An ancient culture (circa 2100-1800 BCE) known for advanced metallurgy, horse domestication, and chariot technology. Within this narrative, they represent one of the post-catastrophe civilizations that preserved fragments of Titan knowledge and technology.

## S

**Seventeen-to-One Ratio** - The extreme reproductive bottleneck (~8,000-5,000 years ago) where only 1 man successfully reproduced for every 17 women who bore children. Represents systematic elimination of competing male lineages and creation of genetic foundation for later ruling classes.

## T

**Tertiary Consciousness** - The ability to transcend binary programming and hold multiple perspectives simultaneously without needing to collapse them into simple either/or choices. This represents an evolutionary step beyond the binary thinking that characterizes most human consciousness.

**Trinity Reinterpretation** - Within this functional mythology, traditional religious concepts can be understood through consciousness frameworks. One interpretation views the Christian Trinity as representing three levels of human consciousness: the Father as the Soul (the eternal, conscious observer), the Son as the NPC (the programmed personality that interfaces with physical reality), and the Holy Spirit as the Energy (the life force that animates both). This reframing suggests that religious traditions may have encoded sophisticated understanding of consciousness architecture in symbolic form.

**Titans** - The older generation of beings (Tiamat, Abzu, Lahmu/Lahamu, Anshar/Kishar) who initiated the original human experiment. They operated on geological timescales with patient, evolutionary approach designed to eventually produce independent conscious beings. Overthrown by the younger Anunnaki generation during the Younger Dryas catastrophe.

## U

**Umannu** - The successful line of genetically modified humans that emerged from the MIS 6 Modification Period and survived the Phase III activation. This term represents modern *Homo sapiens* - the species that carries the full Titan genetic modifications and consciousness programming installed during the glacial refugia enhancements.

## P

**Perseus Protocol** - The archetypal approach to consciousness liberation that allows individuals to see and transform programming without being overwhelmed. Named after the mythological hero who used a mirror shield to defeat Medusa without looking directly at her. Represents the technology of indirect seeing—approaching difficult truths through reflection, metaphor, and strategic perspective rather than direct confrontation. The three Perseus tools are: the Mirror Shield (reflective awareness), Winged Sandals (dimensional mobility), and the Sword of Discrimination (precise discernment).

## Y

**Yahweh** - Within this framework, one of the seventy sons of El assigned to govern specific human populations. Not a "bad" faction but a territorial divine authority competing with divine siblings for influence. The name "Israel" (Isra-El) means "those who struggle with El," suggesting eventual conflict with the higher divine hierarchy. Represents both political divine management and authentic spiritual relationship that generated genuine wisdom and moral development.

**Younger Dryas** - A period of climatic cooling approximately 12,800 years ago, marked by significant environmental changes and the extinction of many large mammals. In this framework, it represents the time of the cosmic war that destroyed Titan civilization and reshaped human destiny.
