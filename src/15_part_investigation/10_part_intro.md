## Part 2: The Investigation - Assembling the Puzzle

*Dr. Sarah Tyra stood before the whiteboard in the Stanford conference room, marker in hand, staring at the timeline she had just drawn. Six months of independent research by her team had produced a collection of anomalies that defied conventional explanation. But now, seeing them arranged chronologically, a pattern was beginning to emerge.*

*"We've been treating these as separate mysteries," she said to the assembled researchers. "But what if they're not? What if every anomaly we've discovered is part of the same story?"*

*Dr. Elena Vasquez studied the timeline. "The genetic bottleneck at 7,000 years ago... that's exactly when we see the mass burial of advanced sites like Göbekli Tepe."*

*Dr. Marcus Chen nodded slowly. "And the 'absent gods' programming that Dr. Petrov identified... the mythological sources date it to the same period."*

*Dr. Rebecca Morrison pulled up her genetic data. "The Beaker and Corded Ware population replacements... they're not random migrations. They're systematic, coordinated, continental-scale operations."*

*The room fell silent as the implications sank in. They were no longer looking at isolated anomalies. They were looking at evidence of a coordinated, long-term project that had shaped human development for millennia.*

*"If we're right about this," Dr. Tyra said quietly, "then everything we thought we knew about human history is wrong. And someone has been working very hard to keep it that way."*

The investigation that follows represents one of the most challenging intellectual journeys in modern science. It requires abandoning comfortable assumptions about human development and following the evidence wherever it leads, no matter how disturbing the implications.

What the team discovered would change not only their understanding of the past, but their perception of the present—and their vision of humanity's future.
