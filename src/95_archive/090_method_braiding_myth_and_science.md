# Appendix G: Method — Braiding Myth and Science

This method note explains how this book weaves functional mythology with scientific evidence without collapsing one into the other.

## Principles

- Functional myth as hypothesis space: treat myths as compressed records of processes, not literal journalism
- Science as constraint: genetics, archaeology, climatology set boundary conditions for plausible readings
- Bidirectional testing: myth informs where to look; science tests the where/when; iteration narrows possibilities
- Names as functions: titles (Architects, Teachers, Administrators) often travel between cultures; map functions first, labels second

## Process

1) Establish functional roles (Architects/Werdh‑anes, Teachers/Gneh‑tah, Administrators/Reges, Hybrids/Wiros)
2) Build a backbone timeline from cross‑disciplinary signals (bottlenecks, tech packages, climate events)
3) Place myth episodes along the backbone where functions and signals match (e.g., Flood Reset at ~2350 BCE)
4) Seek convergences (multiple traditions preserving the same structure with local color)
5) Falsify aggressively: prefer fewer, stronger correspondences to many, vague ones

## Reader Guidance

- Follow the chapter narratives for story; use appendices for evidence scaffolding
- When a tale repeats across cultures with equivalent roles, treat it as signal
- If a scientific signal has multiple mythic echoes, keep the functional mapping and note variations

## Example: Adamu (Forging) → Activation → Resets

- Bottleneck (≈930–813 kya) consolidates foundational stock (“Adamu”)
- Younger Dryas “Activation vs. Domestication” explains Neolithic social architecture
- Flood and Chariot campaigns are paired resets mapped to strong archaeological signals

## Limits and Humility

- This is a working model, not dogma; it evolves with better data
- Myth gives meaning; science keeps us honest; both are needed to see the whole
