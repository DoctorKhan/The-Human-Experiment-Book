# Chapter 17: Method: Braiding Myth and Science

This method treats myth as structured cultural memory and science as the testing and measurement lens. Use both without forcing either to become the other.

## Principles

- Two lenses: Myth suggests patterns; science tests them.
- Shared anchors: Translate motifs to neutral terms (e.g., “Deluge” → abrupt aridification and sociopolitical reset).
- Independent convergence: Require at least two unrelated evidence families to support any major alignment.
- Uncertainty honest: Prefer windows and bands over precise dates where data don’t justify precision.
- Anti-overfit: Name what would falsify the alignment and list viable alternatives.

## Repeatable Section Recipe
1) Mythic Frame (150–300 words)
2) Translation Layer (motifs → neutral anchors)
3) Testable Claims (3–5 falsifiable bullets)
4) Evidence Triad (pick 2–3): climate proxies, aDNA, archaeology, linguistics, chronology
5) Convergence / Divergence (agreements vs tensions)
6) Confidence + Open Questions + Next Test

## Provenance Grading (Legend)

- Myth-Primary (M1): Core mythic motif
- Myth-Parallel (M2): Similar motif in another tradition
- Proxy-Strong (P1): Multiple, dated datasets concur
- Proxy-Moderate (P2): One solid dataset or indirect indicator
- Proxy-Weak (P3): Suggestive or preliminary

## Mini-Example

- Motif: “Giants before the Flood” (M1)
- Anchor: Outlier stature & elite burials (neutral)
- Claims: (i) Outlier skeletal metrics cluster in pre-reset layers; (ii) Discontinuous elite mortuary traditions across reset horizon.
- Evidence: Osteometrics (P2), mortuary stratigraphy (P2), aDNA outliers (P1 when present).
- Convergence: Outliers decline after reset horizon.
- Divergence: Cultural gigantism metaphors may confound.
- Confidence: Moderate; Next: Expand osteometric sampling and aDNA screen of elite graves across the horizon.
