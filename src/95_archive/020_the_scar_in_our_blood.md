If we inherited a world from giants, what became of us? This chapter tells the tragic story of our own transformation.

Using the "three skulls" anecdote, we narrate the story of our domestication. We were not the proud inheritors of the giants' world, but a deliberately cultivated, childlike species designed to be manageable. The chapter frames this not as a scientific curiosity, but as a profound tragedy—the forging of a race of "permanent children." This is the deep, genetic scar left by the victors of the ancient war, and the loss of the Tree of Life.

The air smelled of dust and disinfectant. My friend, deep in her research, didn’t bring out fossils or bones. Instead, she handed me three photographs—close-ups of skulls, each lit from the same angle, each anonymous.

“Which one’s the adult chimp?” she asked.

I studied the first image: heavy brow, powerful jaw, unmistakably mature. The second was smaller, rounder, softer—clearly a baby. The third was delicate, with childlike proportions, the jaw almost fragile.

“That’s the baby chimp,” I said, pointing to the third.

She smiled, a strange, knowing look in her eyes. “That’s an adult human.”

I stared at the photos, then at her. The resemblance between the baby chimp and the adult human wasn’t just passing; it was structural, deep in the bone. The architecture of an adult human head mirrored that of an infant ape—a design that prized youth over maturity, vulnerability over strength.

The three images no longer felt like specimens. They felt like a riddle. If we are the children, then who are the parents?

This level of neoteny doesn't happen by accident in nature. It requires systematic selection pressure over many generations. What if we weren't looking at natural evolution, but at evidence of a deliberate breeding program?

The scientific gaps remain: between 800,000 and 130,000 years ago, human evolution becomes a tangled mess. Multiple human species coexisted, interbred, and left behind confusing fossils that defy a simple, linear family tree. Mainstream science acknowledges these mysteries and has been unable to solve them, leaving the door open for a deeper investigation.

The disturbing question: Were we domesticated by design? The next chapter explores the cosmic fingerprints in our biology.
