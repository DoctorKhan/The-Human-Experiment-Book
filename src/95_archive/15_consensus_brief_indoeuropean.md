Within our mythology, we explore resonances. This interlude presents the current scholarly control model for Indo‑European dispersal that we use to keep our inferences honest [see: References and Sources].

### The Proto‑Indo‑European Homeland and Dispersal (c. 4500–1500 BCE)

Most linguists, archaeologists, and geneticists place the Proto‑Indo‑European (PIE) homeland in the Pontic‑Caspian steppe (c. 4500–2500 BCE). These pastoralist cultures—horse domesticators and likely users of wheeled vehicles—expanded in multiple directions over millennia, carrying a shared linguistic and cultural "toolkit."

As groups spread and became isolated, dialects diverged into distinct branches of the Indo‑European family.

- The Celtic branch moved west across Central and Western Europe. By the Iron Age (roughly 1200 BCE), distinct cultural complexes (e.g., Hallstatt, La Tène) formed in areas spanning modern Austria/Switzerland into France, the British Isles, and parts of Spain.
- The Indo‑Aryan branch moved southeast, with groups entering the Indian subcontinent through the Hindu Kush around 1500 BCE, carrying early forms of Vedic Sanskrit.

Under this model, similarities between Celtic and Vedic cultures are interpreted as inheritances from a common PIE ancestor—not as evidence of a migration out of India into Europe.

### Reinterpreting Shared Cultural Elements

- The Goddess Danu: Likely from a PIE root related to "river" or "flowing water." Appears both in the Rigveda (river deity) and Irish myth (mother of gods), consistent with a shared linguistic substrate.
- Stones and Swastikas: Visual parallels (e.g., standing stones vs. linga, swastika/solar motifs) are not treated as proof of direct transmission. The swastika is globally widespread and often encodes rotation/sun/fortune; Irish standing stones are Neolithic, predating Celtic languages in Ireland.
- Belief in Rebirth: Ideas about the soul’s journey or rebirth appear in many traditions. Such parallels are plausibly PIE‑adjacent or independent convergences rather than evidence of direct Celtic↔Vedic exchange.

### Contextual Notes

- Battle of the Ten Kings (Rigveda): Commonly read as an internal subcontinental conflict among groups already settled in the region, not a dispersal that seeded Europe.
- Genetics: Steppe‑related ancestry components are more pronounced in many northern Indian populations than southern, consistent with migration into (not out of) the subcontinent and subsequent admixture [see: References and Sources].

### What This Does and Doesn’t License

- Does: Explain shared roots of language, deity names, some ritual shapes across far‑flung IE branches.
- Doesn’t: Support an Out‑of‑India migration to Europe; turn poetic correspondences into claims of direct historical transmission without corroborating evidence [see: References and Sources].

Two stories can be true at once: the mythic rhyme that animates this investigation, and the scholarly control that bounds our claims. We proceed with both in view.
