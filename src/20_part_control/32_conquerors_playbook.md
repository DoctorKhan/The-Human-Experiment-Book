# Chapter 15: The Conquerors' Playbook

*Dr. Marcus Chen burst into the conference room three days after their discovery of the \*koryos system, his arms full of comparative mythology texts and his laptop displaying complex mythological charts. His eyes were bright with the terrible excitement of someone who had just decoded humanity's darkest secret.*

*"We've found their names, we've found their methods," he announced breathlessly. "Now I've found their scripture. It's not a book; it's a set of foundational stories that provided the moral and philosophical justification for everything they did. It's **The Reges'** manifesto, and it was so successful that billions of people are still running on its code today without knowing it."*

*Dr. Sarah Tyra looked up from her genetic data. "Marcus, you look like you haven't slept in days."*

*"I haven't," he said, spreading his materials across the table. "But I've cracked the ideological layer. The PIE myths aren't just quaint stories; they are a coherent and brutal philosophical system. They're the software programs that were installed into human consciousness to run on the linguistic code we decoded."*

## The Master Program: Creation by Dismemberment

Dr. Chen began with the most fundamental myth, pulling up comparative charts showing its echoes across cultures.

"This is where it all starts," he said, his voice gaining intensity. "The PIE creation myth tells of the cosmos being formed from the dismembered body of a primordial being. You see it in the Norse Ymir, the Vedic Purusha, even echoes in the Babylonian Marduk slaying Tiamat."

He moved to the whiteboard and began drawing a diagram.

**The Myth Structure:**
- **Primordial Being**: A living, conscious cosmos (representing **The Werdh-anes'** worldview)
- **The Dismemberment**: The being is killed and carved up by younger gods
- **The New Creation**: The corpse becomes the material world - bones become mountains, blood becomes rivers, flesh becomes soil

"This is the master program," Dr. Chen explained. "It's a philosophical kill switch for empathy with nature. **The Werdh-anes'** worldview was that the cosmos was a living being to be cultivated. This myth replaces that with a new truth: the world is a **corpse**."

Dr. Vasquez studied the diagram. "You're saying this justified resource extraction?"

"Exactly," Dr. Chen confirmed. "You are not harming a living thing by mining it, drilling it, or clear-cutting it. You are simply utilizing raw materials from a dead giant. This single story de-animates the cosmos and serves as the eternal permit for resource extraction. It's the birth of materialism."

## The Propaganda Masterpiece: The Hero Slays the Serpent

Dr. Chen moved to his next chart, showing the widespread pattern of dragon-slaying myths.

"This is their propaganda masterpiece," he said. "The core PIE myth of the heroic sky god—**\*Perkʷūnos**—slaying the great chthonic serpent—**\*h₂ógʷʰis**. You see it everywhere: Thor and Jörmungandr, Indra and Vritra, Zeus and Typhon, Saint George and the Dragon."

**The Mythological Pattern:**
- **The Serpent**: Ancient symbol of earth, water, natural cycles, healing, consciousness
- **The Hero**: Sky god representing order, control, patriarchal authority
- **The Battle**: Cosmic conflict between natural chaos and imposed order
- **The Victory**: Hero slays serpent, establishes new cosmic order

"Who is the serpent?" Dr. Chen asked rhetorically. "It's the ancient symbol of **The Werdh-anes'** and **The Gneh-tah's** power: the Earth, water, natural cycles, healing, and consciousness itself. It is the living, writhing, uncontrollable life force."

Dr. Petrov leaned forward. "And **The Reges** rebranded it as evil?"

"Exactly," Dr. Chen said. "They took this symbol of vitality and rebranded it as a monstrous, chaotic evil. Their hero—the **Wiros**—who slays it is celebrated for bringing 'order.' This isn't a myth; it's the mythological record of the **War on Magic**. It provided the moral justification for every persecution of **Gneh-tah** wisdom that followed."

## The Malware Patch: Fire Theft and Pandora's Box

Dr. Chen pulled up the Greek myth of Prometheus, his expression growing darker.

"This one shows their paranoia and their methods for controlling knowledge," he said. "Prometheus—clearly a Titan/**Werdh-anes** echo—steals fire from Zeus and gives it to humanity. But look at the reaction."

**The Myth Sequence:**
- **The Gift**: Prometheus (Gneh-tah sympathizer) gives fire (consciousness technology) to humans
- **The Punishment**: Zeus tortures Prometheus eternally as a warning to other divine whistleblowers
- **The Countermeasure**: Zeus sends Pandora's Box to humanity, releasing toil, disease, and despair

"'Fire' wasn't literal fire," Dr. Chen explained. "It was a spark of consciousness technology—the knowledge of self-liberation. The reaction from **The Reges** was pure system security. Zeus's eternal torture of Prometheus was a brutal message to any other divine whistleblowers."

Dr. Morrison looked up from her notes. "And Pandora's Box?"

"A **malware patch**," Dr. Chen said grimly. "They infected the human system with toil, disease, and despair—all the anxieties that keep us too focused on survival to ever have the time or energy to cultivate that inner fire. It was a brilliant, tragic act of psychological warfare."

## The Historical Memory: War of the Gods

Dr. Chen moved to Norse mythology, showing the conflict between the Æsir and Vanir.

"This story remembers the takeover with surprising accuracy," he said. "The Vanir—fertility and magic gods, archetypal **Werdh-anes**/**Gneh-tah**—versus the Æsir—war and law gods, archetypal **Reges**."

**The Norse Account:**
- **The Vanir**: Gods of fertility, wisdom, magic, natural harmony
- **The Æsir**: Gods of war, law, hierarchical order
- **The Conflict**: War between the two divine factions
- **The Resolution**: Not total victory, but a truce where the Æsir co-opt Vanir magic

"The ending is the crucial part," Dr. Chen emphasized. "It wasn't a total victory, but a truce where the Æsir **co-opted** the Vanir's magic. This is the key. **The Reges** didn't destroy all consciousness technology; they made it **taboo for humanity** while reserving it for their own elite."

Dr. Kim's eyes widened. "That explains the entire history of secret societies and ruling-class esotericism."

"Exactly," Dr. Chen confirmed. "The magic was never gone; it was just privatized."

## The Social Blueprint: Three Functions and the \*Koryos

Dr. Chen moved to his final chart, showing the PIE social structure.

"This was their social blueprint," he said. "The PIE three-function social structure: Priests, Warriors, and Producers. But it's not just a hierarchy—it's a control system."

**The Three Functions:**
- **Priests**: Human administrators of the **Yewes Domains** (sacred law)
- **Warriors**: Domain of the **Wiros**, the hybrid enforcers
- **Producers**: The rest of humanity, the **Menes**, whose energy fueled the system

"And how did they enforce this new structure?" Dr. Chen asked. "With the **\*koryos**. These warrior bands were **The Reges'** human weapon system—the fanatical, brutal shock troops who carried this entire ideological package across Europe and Asia."

Dr. Vasquez nodded grimly. "Wiping out the peaceful, **Gneh-tah**-influenced cultures in their path."

"The Bell Beaker expansion wasn't a migration," Dr. Chen confirmed. "It was a crusade fueled by this mythological software."

## The Terrifying Realization

The room fell silent as the full implications sank in.

Dr. Tyra was the first to speak. "These myths... they're still active, aren't they?"

Dr. Chen nodded slowly. "Creation by Dismemberment justifies environmental destruction. Hero Slays Serpent demonizes natural healing and consciousness practices. Fire Theft warns against sharing liberating knowledge. War of Gods explains why magic is reserved for elites. Three Functions maintains social hierarchy."

"And the **\*koryos** system," Dr. Petrov added quietly, "is still recruiting young men into warrior bands that carry ideological programming."

Dr. Morrison looked around the room. "We're not just studying ancient history. We're reverse-engineering the foundational narratives that have been shaping Western and South Asian civilization for 5,000 years."

## The Modern Manifestation

Dr. Chen moved to a fresh section of the whiteboard.

"Look around you," he said. "These programs are running everywhere:
- **Corporate culture** treats the Earth as dead resources to be extracted
- **Military-industrial complex** celebrates heroes who slay the 'serpents' of foreign cultures
- **Educational systems** suppress consciousness technologies while promoting analytical materialism
- **Religious institutions** maintain the priest-warrior-producer hierarchy
- **Media systems** perpetuate the mythological programming through endless hero narratives"

Dr. Vasquez studied her archaeological data with new understanding. "The conquest never ended. It just became invisible."

"Which means," Dr. Chen said quietly, "that **The Reges** are still winning. Their ideological software has been so successful that most people can't even imagine alternatives to it."

*As the team absorbed the magnitude of their discovery, they realized they had uncovered not just ancient history, but the active operating system of modern civilization. The myths that **The Reges** had installed 5,000 years ago were still running, still shaping human consciousness, still justifying the same patterns of domination and extraction.*

*But Dr. Chen was already noticing fragments that didn't fit this pattern—suppressed stories that seemed to have been deliberately erased from both **Reges** propaganda and **Gneh-tah** lore. Stories suggesting that someone had once fought back, though the details remained frustratingly incomplete.*

*The question was no longer just what **The Reges** had believed. It was whether humanity could ever break free from the mythological programming that had defined civilization itself.*
