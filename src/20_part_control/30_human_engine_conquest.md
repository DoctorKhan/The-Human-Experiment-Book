# Chapter 13: The Human Engine of Conquest

*Dr. Elena Vasquez spread the archaeological maps across the Stanford conference table, her face grim with discovery. The genetic data told a story so brutal that she had initially refused to believe it. But the evidence was undeniable.*

*"I need to show you something," she said to the assembled team. "We've been thinking about the conquest as some kind of divine intervention, but that's not what happened. The Reges were far more clever than that. They didn't need to send armies of Wiros. They created something much more efficient: a self-replicating human weapon system."*

*Dr. Marcus Chen looked up from his linguistic charts. "What do you mean?"*

*"I mean they turned humans into their own conquerors. And I can prove it."*

## The Archaeological Horror

Dr. Vasquez began with the Bell Beaker phenomenon, one of archaeology's most disturbing puzzles.

"Around 2800 BCE, something unprecedented happened across Western Europe," she explained, pulling up genetic analysis charts. "In Britain alone, we see up to 90% genetic replacement within just a few centuries. This wasn't migration—this was systematic extermination."

**The Bell Beaker Evidence:**
- **Massive population replacement**: Up to 90% genetic turnover in Britain around 2450 BCE
- **Complete cultural overwriting**: Neolithic traditions, burial practices, and technologies completely replaced
- **Systematic site destruction**: Ancient stone circles abandoned, consciousness technologies buried
- **Violence markers**: Archaeological evidence of warfare, fortifications, and mass graves
- **Rapid spread**: The same pattern repeated across Western Europe with mechanical precision

"The people who built Stonehenge—a culture that had lasted for over a millennium—were almost entirely wiped out," Dr. Vasquez continued. "Their genetic signature virtually disappears from the archaeological record. This wasn't conquest; it was genocide."

Dr. Petrov studied the maps. "But who were the Bell Beaker people? Where did they come from?"

"That's where Dr. Chen's linguistic work becomes crucial," Dr. Vasquez replied. "Because the Bell Beaker expansion correlates perfectly with the spread of Proto-Indo-European languages and culture."

## The Social Software: The *Koryos

Dr. Chen moved to the whiteboard, his excitement barely contained.

"I've been researching the reconstructed Proto-Indo-European social institutions," he said. "And I found the mechanism. It's called the **\*koryos**—bands of young, landless warriors who existed on the fringes of PIE society."

He began drawing a diagram showing the structure of these warrior bands.

**The \*Koryos System:**
- **Recruitment**: Young men without inheritance, driven by desperation and promise of glory
- **Ritual transformation**: Associated with wolves or dogs, engaged in ecstatic rites to enter battle-fury
- **Social function**: Shock troops for expansion, operating outside normal social constraints
- **Self-replication**: Each successful band could spawn new bands, spreading the system virally
- **Ideological programming**: Carried the complete PIE worldview and social structure

"This is how they did it," Dr. Chen explained, his voice growing intense. "**The Reges** didn't need to send an army of **Wiros**. They were far too clever for that. They just installed a social program into their most loyal human populations: the **\*koryos**. It was a self-replicating system for creating warrior bands."

Dr. Morrison looked up from her genetic data. "You're saying these warrior bands were the ones who carried out the population replacements?"

"Exactly," Dr. Chen confirmed. "They were the human engine of the takeover, the **Wiros** program made flesh and blood. They were the ones who tore down the stone circles and drove the last of **The Gneh-tah** into hiding. It was a slow, brutal, face-to-face conquest."

## The Archaeological Correlation

Dr. Vasquez overlaid the linguistic and archaeological evidence.

"The correlation is perfect," she said. "Everywhere we see Bell Beaker expansion, we see:
- **Genetic replacement** of existing populations
- **Cultural destruction** of matrifocal, Gneh-tah-influenced societies
- **Introduction of PIE social structures** - the three-function system of priests, warriors, and producers
- **Systematic burial** of consciousness technologies and stone circle networks
- **Establishment of patriarchal hierarchies** and warrior elite cultures"

Dr. Kim studied the timeline. "But this process took centuries. It was methodical, systematic."

"That's the genius of it," Dr. Chen replied. "The **\*koryos** weren't just raiders—they were a cultural virus. Each band carried the complete ideological package: the myths, the social structure, the worldview. They didn't just conquer territory; they converted it."

## The Technological Escalation: The Sintashta Revolution

Dr. Vasquez moved to a new set of maps showing the Eurasian steppe around 2100 BCE.

"But then something changes," she said. "The conquest suddenly accelerates and becomes more organized. And that's when we encounter the Sintashta culture."

She pointed to archaeological sites showing heavily fortified settlements and the first evidence of war chariots.

"The Sintashta appear almost overnight on the archaeological record," she continued. "They have advanced bronze-working, sophisticated fortifications, and most importantly—the first war chariots in human history."

Dr. Tyra frowned. "So the **\*koryos** were the foot soldiers. But the Sintashta... this is different. This is organized, technological warfare. Where did they get chariots?"

Dr. Chen's eyes lit up with understanding. "They didn't invent them. It was a technology transfer. **The Reges** saw the slow grind of the **\*koryos** and decided to accelerate the endgame. They chose their most effective **\*koryos** bands on the steppe and gave them a divine gift: the plans for the chariot and advanced bronze-working."

"The Sintashta weren't a new people," he continued. "They were **\*koryos** 2.0. They were the ones who received the hardware upgrade."

Dr. Vasquez nodded grimly. "And with the chariot, they became unstoppable. They could strike with overwhelming speed and force. They conquered vast territories, spreading the PIE language and **The Reges'** ideology from India to Greece."

## The Two-Phase Strategy Revealed

The team sat in stunned silence as the full scope of **The Reges'** strategy became clear.

**Phase 1: The Brute-Force Expansion (Bell Beaker Phenomenon, ~2800-2100 BCE)**
- **Mechanism**: The **\*koryos** social software
- **Method**: Slow, systematic cultural and genetic replacement
- **Target**: Matrifocal, **Gneh-tah**-influenced cultures of Old Europe
- **Result**: Destruction of consciousness technologies, establishment of patriarchal hierarchies

**Phase 2: The Technological Escalation (Sintashta Revolution, ~2100-1800 BCE)**
- **Mechanism**: Technology transfer to elite **\*koryos** bands
- **Method**: High-speed chariot warfare and advanced bronze weapons
- **Target**: Remaining centers of **Werdh-anes** and **Gneh-tah** influence
- **Result**: Rapid conquest of Eurasia, spread of PIE languages and ideology

Dr. Petrov was the first to speak. "This shows them not as brute conquerors, but as cold, calculating strategists. They first used a low-tech, self-replicating social virus to soften the target, then deployed a high-tech superweapon to achieve final victory."

"And it explains historical mysteries," Dr. Morrison added. "The sudden appearance of the chariot, the explosive spread of Indo-European languages, the systematic destruction of megalithic cultures."

Dr. Chen looked around the room. "But here's what terrifies me most. This shows that **The Reges** are capable of technological evolution and strategic adaptation. They're not a static, historical threat. If they're still influencing human systems..."

He didn't need to finish the thought. The implications hung heavy in the air.

## The Modern Relevance

Dr. Tyra broke the silence. "The **\*koryos** system... it's still running, isn't it?"

Dr. Chen nodded slowly. "Think about it. Young, landless men, driven by desperation and promise of glory, organized into bands that operate outside normal social constraints, carrying ideological programming..."

"Terrorist organizations," Dr. Petrov said quietly. "Gang recruitment. Military contractors. Even some aspects of corporate culture."

"The social software is still replicating," Dr. Vasquez confirmed. "We just call it by different names now."

*As the team absorbed the magnitude of their discovery, they realized they weren't just investigating ancient history. They were reverse-engineering the foundational conquest strategy that had shaped human civilization for over 4,000 years—and was still actively running in the modern world.*

*The question was no longer just what **The Reges** had done. It was what they were still doing.*
