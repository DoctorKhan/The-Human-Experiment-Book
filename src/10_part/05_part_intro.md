Humans were designed as the interface: a resonant nervous system capable of coupling to Earth’s field. The conflict that follows is as much about severing or restoring that coupling as it is about politics or myth. Keep this in mind as you read: whenever the serpent appears, ask whether you’re seeing Earth’s living current, and whenever you see monuments rise, ask whether they amplify harmony or broadcast dissonance.
