# Chapter X: Cosmic Fingerprints

The first time I held a fragment of the Murchison meteorite, I expected to feel awe. Instead, I felt a strange kind of déjà vu, as if the pebble already knew something about us. The lab reports were dry: amino acids, nucleobases, sugars, lipids. But the strangeness hid in the small details—the tilt toward left-handedness, the isotopic accents that didn’t quite match Earth’s voice. It read like an accent in a familiar language.

If these are just stones, why do they carry preferences that line up so neatly with ours? Maybe that’s all it is: the universe being generous with biased ingredients. Or maybe those biases are the fingerprints of a longer story—the way a master baker’s sourdough feeds new loaves long after the original kitchen is gone.


Some characteristics of Earth life carry signatures that feel older than Earth itself—not proof of aliens, but fingerprints in stone and ice.

We start with caveats. L-enantiomer excesses can be produced abiotically (circularly polarized UV light; mineral templating). Unusual isotopic ratios can emerge without biology. ALH 84001 is disputed, and contamination is a real risk. That is why we treat each datapoint as a bias, not a verdict, and look for a pattern that survives the caveats.

The pattern looks like this. A tilt toward the same left-handedness life prefers. Isotopic accents that speak in a dialect not quite our own. Survival envelopes that make sense only if the hardware had to endure vacuum, radiation, and time. None of this demands directed panspermia. The minimal claim is simpler: the cosmos supplied biased inputs and survivability constraints that shaped our starting conditions—and maybe, occasionally, our updates.

Can we test it? Yes. Replicate L-excess under space-like conditions. Model isotopic pathways with clean provenance. Chart survival curves for biomolecules and spores under realistic radiation spectra and shielding. If the biases persist under scrutiny, they become fingerprints we can track across time.

If the inputs carry fingerprints, perhaps the tempo does too. That is the question we take into the next chapter.
